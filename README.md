> In this assignment, I learned how to create a node server. I learned how to use the .createServer and .listen in generating your own server. I also learned how to make the 404 fallback with the help of chatgpt. I also learned how to install the npm packages and how to use the req and res by watching some videos in youtube. It was really helpful for me in doing this assignment because it gave me more knowledge about javascript.
